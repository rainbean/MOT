# Description

Multiple object tracking practice.

## Development Plan

* Dataset
  - [ ] Support [MOT 2017](https://motchallenge.net/results/MOT17Det/) dataset
  - [ ] Visualize ground-truth per frame, and render as video animation
* Model architecture
  - Detection
    + [ ] Train Faster RCNN [1](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch),[2](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), pre-trained by ResNet. 
    + [ ] Measure training metrics, and visualize samples
  - Tracking
